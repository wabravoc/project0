## Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The design of my website is based on funeral services.

The web page is divided into 5 windows, the main window is the welcome one, in this it is displayed, the 4 additional windows such as: mission, vision, contacts, and our services.

In the welcome window an @media was used to change a slight appearance of the background in case of reduction of screen for small devices.

Different types of selectors were applied between the windows such as:

tag selectors.
class selector.
identifier selector.
descendant selector.
multiple element selector.
child selector.

I also created a .sass sheet called variables.css where different style functions were saved and referenced to test the functioning of the style sheets in the welcome and contacts window.

You can browse my page through.
